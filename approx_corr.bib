  abstract    = "Technological advances have enabled a new class of
                 multivariate models for ecology, with the potential now to
                 specify a statistical model for abundances jointly across many
                 taxa, to simultaneously explore interactions across taxa and
                 the response of abundance to environmental variables. Joint
                 models can be used for several purposes of interest to
                 ecologists, including estimating patterns of residual
                 correlation across taxa, ordination, multivariate inference
                 about environmental effects and environment-by-trait
                 interactions, accounting for missing predictors, and improving
                 predictions in situations where one can leverage knowledge of
                 some species to predict others. We demonstrate this by example
                 and discuss recent computation tools and future directions.",
